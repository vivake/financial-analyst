# Step 1: Load environment variables
# Load environment variables from .env file to access necessary configurations and secrets

# Step 2: Connect to SQL Database
# Establish a connection to the SQL database to retrieve SEC filings

# Step 3: Retrieve SEC Filings from SQL Database
# Retrieve raw SEC filings data from the SQL database for preprocessing

# Step 4: Preprocess SEC Filings Data
# Clean and preprocess the raw SEC filings data to prepare it for embedding generation

# Step 5: Load FinBERT Model
# Load the FinBERT model to generate embeddings for the cleaned SEC filings data

# Step 6: Generate Embeddings for SEC Filings
# Use the FinBERT model to generate embeddings for the cleaned SEC filings data

# Step 7: Connect to Vector Database
# Establish a connection to the vector database to store the generated embeddings

# Step 8: Store Embeddings in Vector Database
# Store the generated embeddings in the vector database for future retrieval and analysis

# Step 9: Handle Queries
# Set up query handling to process user queries, classify intents, and route them to the appropriate handlers

# Step 10: Augment Context for Queries
# Augment the context for user queries to provide more accurate and relevant responses

# Step 11: Utility Functions
# Utilize any necessary utility functions to support the above steps
