      "Reddit. They're not paid employees. So when other companies say moderators, they're often referring to paid \n",

      " \n",
      "So look, Reddit doesn't exist – Reddit is communities, and the communities are created by users who then \n",

      "focus on with the moderators, giving them good tooling. So we tried that the tooling that we use internally in our \n",
      "safety team, our goal is to expose everything that we have also to moderators, because every community on \n",
      "Reddit has rules, not just unwritten rules, but written rules that are created by the community and enforced by the \n",
      "community. \n",
      " \n",
      "For example, the most common user created rule is some form of be civil or be nice, which is a really important \n",
      "rule. But giving users the ability to enforce their rules at scale is really important. So mod tools are super \n",
      "important. We also spend a lot of time with moderators both on Zoom calls, in-person doing meet-ups. We have a \n",
      "whole program at Reddit called Adopt-an-Admin, so it's where employees, myself included, will actually moderate \n",

      "A \n",
      "Sure. So, look, if I had 20 minutes, I'd give you a fulsome answer here. So, we've been around Reddit since 2005. \n",
      "And so, we predate social media. We predate the word influencer. And so, we've been doing things our own way \n",
      "for a long time, right. We didn't wake up and say, hey, there's a better version of doing this. We've just been doing \n",
      "it this way. But I often frame people – I often frame Reddit in juxtaposition with social media. And so, social media \n",
      "is powered by the Fs, as I call them, friends, followers, family, famous people. And Reddit's organized around \n",
      "community. And so, the dynamics and incentives are really different. \n",
      " \n",
      "Social media also has algorithms that make things popular. Whereas on Reddit, things are made popular through \n",
      "voting and through voting in the context of a community. And every post and comment on Reddit starts out at zero \n",
      "points and has to earn its visibility. And so, what this means is things don't become popular on Reddit unless a \n",
      "group of like-minded people make it popular. And so the content, if you kind of play all this through, what happens \n",
      "is on Reddit, the content is more authentic, and it'll be more vulnerable as well. We don't use real idea on Reddit. \n",
      "So, on Reddit, you'll see people talking about not just like the headlines and what's going on in the world, which \n",
      "they do, and not just the memes which you've pioneered, for better or for worse, or gifs, which are a big part of \n",
      "that too, but everything they're going through in life, right. The ups and downs, relationships, jobs, all those things. \n",
      "And so Reddit, long story short, we describe as the most human place on the Internet. \n",

      "Okay, great. You talked about how you've been around for 19 years. Maybe you could just help us understand the \n",
      "phases of the company. Why it's just this year that Reddit will cross the $1 billion annual revenue mark? \n",

      "Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Reddit, Inc. \n",
      "A \n",
      "Sure. So, the brief timeline. We started in 2005. We actually sold the company in 2006. I left in 2009. Reddit spun \n",
      "out from our acquirer, Advance, in 2012. They're still our largest shareholder. And I returned to the company in \n",
      "2015. When I came back to the company in 2015, we did, I think, $12 million in revenue that year and we're about \n",
      "12 million DAU, I think. We didn't even measure it that accurately back then. And so, the business didn't really get \n",
      "going until the last decade or so. And it wasn't until 2018 that we got our own AdTech going. And so, it's been a \n",
      "journey. We certainly have a lot of perspective on the Internet. But the business part of Reddit is just beginning to \n",
      "scale now. And so, it's like I said, I call it, about $ 1 billion run rate where we are today. So, we've grown nicely in \n",

      "Therefore, do they increase the likelihood they come back? So, we've gotten much, much better at that. So, the \n",

      "that's the bedrock of our ads business. And so, that's really the cornerstone of our revenue. And that is very \n",

      "basically independently of that, and that's been steady and growing for a very long time. \n",

      "Now, a super common question we get is how do we convert the logged-out users into logged-in users? And look, \n",
