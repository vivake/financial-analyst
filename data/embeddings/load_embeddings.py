# Class for loading embeddings
"""
Summary:
This script defines the EmbeddingsLoader class, which is responsible for loading, preprocessing, and saving word embeddings. The class includes the following methods:

1. __init__(self, source_path): Initializes the loader with the path to the embeddings source.
2. load_embeddings(self): Loads embeddings from the specified source path and returns them as a dictionary.
3. preprocess_embeddings(self, embeddings): Preprocesses the loaded embeddings, such as normalizing or filtering, and returns the processed embeddings.
4. save_embeddings(self, embeddings, destination_path): Saves the embeddings to a specified destination path.

The EmbeddingsLoader class can be used to manage word embeddings in various NLP tasks, ensuring they are properly loaded, processed, and stored.
