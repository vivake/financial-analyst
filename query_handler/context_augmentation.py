# Combines and augments retrieved context for response
"""
This script defines a ContextAugmentor class that augments context by combining it with a user query before passing it to a language model. The logical steps are as follows:
1. Define the ContextAugmentor class.
2. Initialize the ContextAugmentor with a context retriever instance.
3. Define a method to augment context by combining it with the query.
4. Retrieve relevant context based on the query using the context retriever.
5. Combine the retrieved context with the query.
6. Return the augmented context.
7. Provide an example usage of the ContextAugmentor class.
